# Hiring-Process-Analysis

## Project Description: 

Hiring process is the fundamental and the most important function of a company. Here, the MNCs get to know about the major underlying trends about the hiring process. Trends such as- number
of hires, number of rejections, number of interviews, types of jobs, vacancies etc. are important for a company to analyze before hiring freshers or any other individual.

Being a Data Analyst, my job is to go through these trends and draw insights out of it for the hiring department to work upon.

## Approach:

Before starting the data analysis I spent some time to data cleaning to get more understandable data - I use Ms Excel to remove duplicate data , deal with unstructured data, detect outlier and remove it if required, handel some missing data and filter some data, summarized data to more visualizations to better understand the data.

After that I use some Excel function, mathematical and statistical function, pivot table to get required data, I create some graphs like Bar grapes, Column grapes to get more visualized data.

## Tech-Stack Used:

I use Microsoft Excel(2022) to explore ,analyze and visualize data.
